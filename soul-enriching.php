                                <p>I recently read a quote which said 'Embrace the glorious mess that you are', and one of the ways I embrace myself is by doing YOGA! It has completely changed my perception and feelings towards Exercise, because it was a struggle for me to go to the gym. But now everyday as I wake-up I look forward to do my YOGA routine/exercise because it not only just rejuvenates my body but also my mind and soul!</p>

                            <p>I started doing YOGA ten months ago from this day if I count. I was just looking for something which keeps me grounded, calm,present and connected to myself because I had taken a huge leap(decision) in my life ,by quitting my ongoing job and taking a journey of self discovery ,to find the real purpose of my existence . So as usual I chose to look for the solution on the most common and accessible searching ground 'THE INTERNET' and that's how YOGA was discovered. I'm glad that that's how I discovered it because I've
come across two of the most amazing women , @sarahbethyoga and @yogawithadrein ,whose YOGA routine I've been following everyday, I consider both of them as my YOGA teachers ,one can easily learn YOGA from them and most importantly connect, I'll connect their Youtube channel link at the end of this post.</p>

                            </div>
                                <p>I still consider myself an amateur in YOGA because I feel that I'm discovering so many different things about me on a everyday basis as I do it, In this 10 month of my YOGA journey I've realized that my body is a free flowing energy, it can get molded as thy wish and can overcome every obstacle because it is no longer separate from the universal energy. YOGA has taught me not just to see but feel my Ambition! So a big shout out from me to all the yogis ;-) and an open invitation with an open heart (from heart chakra) to those who wish to be one ! NAMASTE</p>
